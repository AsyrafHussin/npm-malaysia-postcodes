# Performance Optimization Report

## Overview

This report documents the performance optimizations implemented in `src/index-optimize.ts` to dramatically improve the performance of the npm-malaysia-postcodes library while maintaining 100% functional compatibility with the original implementation.

## Design Philosophy

### Key Principle: No File Size Increase

- All optimizations are designed to maintain or reduce the current library file size
- Focus on algorithmic improvements and efficient data structures
- Avoid adding heavy dependencies or extensive caching that would bloat the bundle
- Smart use of existing data to create optimized indices without duplication

## Optimization Techniques Applied

### 1. Data Structure Optimization

#### Maps for O(1) Lookups

- `stateMap`: State name ‚Üí State object mapping
- `cityToStateMap`: City name ‚Üí State name mapping  
- `cityToPostcodesMap`: City name ‚Üí Postcodes array mapping
- `postcodeToLocationMap`: Postcode ‚Üí Location mapping

**Benefits:**

- Eliminates nested loops for exact matches
- Reduces time complexity from O(n√óm) to O(1)
- Minimal memory overhead since data is just reorganized, not duplicated

### 2. Set-Based Fast Lookups

#### Dedicated Sets for Existence Checks

- `stateNameSet`: Fast state existence validation
- `cityNameSet`: Fast city existence validation  
- `postcodeSet`: Fast postcode existence validation

**Benefits:**

- O(1) existence checks vs O(n) array searches
- Enables early termination of expensive operations
- Uses JavaScript's native Set optimization

### 3. Trie Data Structure for Prefix Matching

#### Custom Trie Implementation

- Optimized specifically for postcode prefix matching
- Each node stores complete postcodes for that prefix
- Maximum depth of 5 (postcode length limit)

**Benefits:**

- Reduces prefix search from O(n) to O(prefix.length)
- Massive improvement for `getPostcodesByPrefix` function
- Memory efficient due to shared prefixes

### 4. Intelligent Caching Strategy

#### Selective Caching

- `citySearchCache`: Caches complex city search results
- `postcodeSearchCache`: Caches postcode search results
- `prefixCache`: Caches prefix search results
- `searchAllCache`: Caches comprehensive search results

**Cache Management:**

- Automatic size management to prevent memory bloat
- LRU-style cleanup keeping 70% of most recent entries
- Configurable cache size limits

### 5. Preprocessed Indices

#### Precomputed Arrays

- `allStateNames`: Ready-to-return state list
- `allCityNames`: Ready-to-return city list
- `allPostcodesList`: Ready-to-return postcode list

**Benefits:**

- Eliminates repeated array generation
- Instant access to commonly requested data
- Zero computation overhead for basic operations
